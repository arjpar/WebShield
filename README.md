# WebShield - Safari Adblocker

### Introduction

WebShield is a wide-spectrum content blocker, akin to uBlock Origin, specifically for Safari.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Note:** WebShield is currently in a beta stage of maturity. Features and documentation are subject to change as we continue to develop and improve the project.

## Features

WebShield can block ads, trackers, cookie notices, and more. You can also import custom filter lists. WebShield supports Safari's Content Blocking API as well as scriptlets & extended css for more advanced, targeted blocking.

## System Requirements

These requirements are tentative and due to change. I will try to support older OSes as much as I can.

- macOS 14 or later
- iOS 17 or later
- visionOS 1.3 or later

## Acknowledgments

WebShield draws inspiration from privacy and performance-focused projects like uBlock Origin. This project wouldn't be possible without the dedication of filter list maintainers who work tirelessly to keep the web clean. I'm deeply grateful to stand on the shoulders of these projects and their contributors. Special thanks to AdGuard, whose tools ‚Äî particularly SafariConverterLib and Scriptlets/ExtendedCSS ‚Äî have been instrumental to WebShield's development. I'd also like to thank @0xCube for our ongoing collaboration and the valuable connection between our projects.
